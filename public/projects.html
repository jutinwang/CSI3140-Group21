                Made a wordle game with a unique set of words facilitating
                vocabulary skills in the player. The game was designed using
                HTML to lay out the grid assets and JavaScript to apply game
                logic and real time action.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                Added a scoring system to the wordle game accounting for streaks
                and a live updated leader board. Game logic was re-implemented
                into PHP server with user interaction being handled by
                JavaScript and game display handled with HTML/CSS. An SQL data
                base was used to store words and scores.

          <h1>Algorithm Visualizer</h1>
          <i>Project of Justin Wang</i>
          <p>
            Created a visualizer for pathfinding algorithms, A* and Dijkstra's,
            that can visualize pathfinding from one node to another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Built the program with Python and used the Tkinter GUI library for
            pop-ups and accepting user inputs for where to place the start and
            end nodes
          </p>
          <p>
            Used Pygame library to create UI that allows users to place nodes on
            a 50x50 grid and draw barriers to change the algorithm's path

          <p>
            Implemented a meal prep service moderated by an admin, used by cooks
            and accessed by clients to request, purchase and rate cook services.
