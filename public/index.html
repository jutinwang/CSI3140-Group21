    <h4>Projects</h4>
    <p>Alogrithm Visualizer</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Created a visualizer for pathfinding algorithms, A* and Dijkstra's, that
        can visualize pathfinding from one node to another
      </li>
      <li>
        Built the program with Python and used the Tkinter GUI library for
        pop-ups and accepting user inputs for where to place the start and end
        nodes
      </li>
      <li>
        Used Pygame library to create UI that allows users to place nodes on a
        50x50 grid and draw barriers to change the algorithm's path
      </li>
